# Tech Blog
## Description
This project was undertaken as part of a coding bootcamp. For this challenge we were tasked with creating a full-stack blog website. The user shold be able to login securely. If they do not hav an account yet they should be taken to a register page. After logging is they are taken to their own dashboard page where they can create a blog post. They can also edit or delete past blog posts they created. If they click the logo they are taken to the homepage where they can see all users posts and can make comments on the posts.
